# DNR: AI-Powered Detection Engineering

This repository showcases an AI-powered detection engineering service for organizations with:
- bespoke technologies (custom, in-house systems)
- commodity technologies (common commercial and open-source platforms)
- custom integrations across internal and third-party environments

## What this project demonstrates

- AI-assisted threat discovery from technical documentation and environment context
- STRIDE-aligned threat modeling workflows
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping for prioritized detection opportunities
- Flexible integration patterns that adapt to heterogeneous enterprise stacks

## Repository structure

```text
DNR/
├── discovery_agent/        # Discovery workflow for STRIDE + ATT&CK mapping
├── bedrock-agent-vanilla/  # Bedrock-based agent implementation
└── raw-agent-vanilla/      # Baseline/raw agent implementation
```

## Goal

Provide a practical reference for building and operating detection engineering services that can rapidly generate, adapt, and scale detections across mixed technology environments.
