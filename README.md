# DNR: AI-Powered Detection Engineering

This repository showcases an AI-powered detection engineering service for organizations with:
- bespoke technologies (custom, in-house systems)
- commodity technologies with custom integrations across internal and third-party environments

## What this project demonstrates

- AI-powered threat discovery from technical documentation and environment context
- STRIDE-aligned threat modeling agent
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping for prioritized detection opportunities

## Repository structure
